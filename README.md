# SingBuses [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/itachi1706/SingBuses.svg?branch=1.1)](https://travis-ci.org/itachi1706/SingBuses)

This is the Official Repository of the SingBuses Android App. The main objective of this app was to provide bus arrival timings in
Singapore while at the same time, be able to send the data onto a smart wearable device. As of this moment, only the Pebble smartwatch
(Original Pebble and Pebble Steel) are supported.

Releases are located [here](https://github.com/itachi1706/SingBuses/releases)

| Device | Is Supported |
| ------ | ------------ |
| Original Pebble | Yes |
| Pebble Steel | Yes |
| Pebble Time | Partially (no SDK 3 or color support) |
| Pebble Time Steel | Partially (no SDK 3 or color support) |
| Android Wear | No (Planned) |
| Apple Watch | Hell No (Its an Android only thing) |
| S Watch | No (Is there even an SDK for that?) |
| Google Glass | Nope |
| Any other wearables | Nope |

This application is not licensed under any open source license as of now until I feel the need to open source it. And the reason I don't feel the need to right now is because its incomplete and the code base probably sucks.
