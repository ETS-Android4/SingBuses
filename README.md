This is the Official Repository of the Bus Arrivals @ SG Android App. The main objective of this app was to provide bus arrival timings in
Singapore while at the same time, be able to send the data onto a smart wearable device. As of this moment, only the Pebble smartwatch
(Original Pebble and Pebble Steel) are supported.

**This app uses Firebase Analytics, as such if you are meeting any crashes or errors related to it, make sure you have generated a google-services.json file from your Firebase project and add it to the app/ folder**

Releases are located [here](https://github.com/itachi1706/SingBuses/releases)

| Device | Is Supported | Remarks |
| ------ | ------------ | ------- |
| Original Pebble | Yes |  |
| Pebble Steel | Yes |  |
| Pebble Time Series | Yes | Black and White For Now |
| Pebble Time 2 Series | Technically Yes (Untested) |  |
| Pebble 2 Series | Technically Yes (Untested) |  |
| Android Wear | No (Planned) |  |
| Apple Watch | Hell No (Its an Android only thing) |  |
| S Watch | No (Is there even an SDK for that?) |  |
| Google Glass | Nope |  |
| Any other wearables | Nope |  |

This application is not licensed under any open source license as of now until I feel the need to open source it. And the reason I don't feel the need to right now is because its incomplete and the code base probably sucks.
