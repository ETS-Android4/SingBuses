This is the Official Repository of the Bus Arrivals @ SG Android App. The main objective of this app was to provide bus arrival timings in
Singapore while at the same time, be able to send the data onto a smart wearable device. As of this moment, only the Pebble smartwatch
(Original Pebble and Pebble Steel) are supported.

Releases are located [here](https://github.com/itachi1706/SingBuses/releases)

| Device | Is Supported | Remarks |
| ------ | ------------ | ------- |
| Original Pebble | Yes | SDK 2 |
| Pebble Steel | Yes | SDK 2 |
| Pebble Time | Partially (In-Progress) |  |
| Pebble Time Steel | Partially (In-Progress) |  |
| Pebble Time Round | Partially (In-Progress) |  |
| Android Wear | No (Planned) |  |
| Apple Watch | Hell No (Its an Android only thing) |  |
| S Watch | No (Is there even an SDK for that?) |  |
| Google Glass | Nope |  |
| Any other wearables | Nope |  |

This application is not licensed under any open source license as of now until I feel the need to open source it. And the reason I don't feel the need to right now is because its incomplete and the code base probably sucks.
